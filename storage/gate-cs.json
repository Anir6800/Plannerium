This is highly inefficient. Increase the dedicated weekly hours to a more standard full-time (e.g., 40 hours/week) or full-time equivalent allocation across resources.",
      "impact": "Reduces overall project timeline drastically from 96 weeks to ~39-50 weeks (depending on task parallelization), directly mitigating 'Schedule Overruns Due to Underestimated Effort' (Risk 7) and accelerating time-to-market. This is the single biggest optimization.",
